This package is designed to streamline the process of gathering information from users who would like to volunteer at certain locations within New York. For the sake of this project, I decided to keep it simple and catalog the locations and their corresponding addresses to a dictionary. 

Our volunteer_info file takes in the information from the user in order to determine who they are and where they're from. 

Our list_of_locations file is where the majority of the background work is being done, as it takes our user input and outputs their preference to the type of place they would want to work, and then selecting a location, based off of the information given in the dictionaries. 

Finally, we have our Recommend file, which ties it all together and confirms whether or not the user would like to work at the location they have selected. If not, it will recommend another location within their desired places to work at.
